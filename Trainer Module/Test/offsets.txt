(These offsets are only in an compiled .EXE of the Trainme program!)
Remember that the window name is "Trainme" (without the quotes)

Beacuse of the fact that a program's memory offsets differs between
windows versions I have only been able to find offsets for Windows 98se and Windows ME.

So here are the offsets for Win98SE:
Byte variable:    00510478
Integer variable: 0051047A
Long variable:    0051047C

And WinME:
Byte variable:    00510458
Integer variable: 0051045A
Long variable:    0051045C
